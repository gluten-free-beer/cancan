# CanCan client-side scripts

- **./samples/scripts/videoSync.js**

A minimal CanCan data (CANDY) loader to render/sync data on the client side. Data preprocessing required. Formatting is optimized here. Simply replace parameters and it's good to go.

- **./samples/scripts/cropByBboxes.js**

A simple supplementary snippet to render video frames cropped by bounding boxes in real time. Can be inserted into the script above to render merchandise reference images directly from the videos on the fly.

Note that a stock video is used for illustration. Source: <a>https://www.pexels.com/video/fashion-costume-clothing-workshop-4620476/</a>
